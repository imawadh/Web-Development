                    rock climbers and adventure seekers. <span class="yellowa">The Hindu and Buddhist </span>heritage of Nepal and its cool

                    Nepal. Mountaineering and other types of adventure tourism and ecotourism are important
                    attractions for visitors. The World Heritage Site Lumbini, birthplace of Buddha, is located in the
                    south of the West region of Nepal (which despite the name is located in the center of the country)
                    and there are other important religious pilgrimage sites throughout the country. The tourist industry
                    is seen as a way to alleviate poverty and achieve greater social equity in the country. Tourism brings
                    $471 million a year to Nepal.
