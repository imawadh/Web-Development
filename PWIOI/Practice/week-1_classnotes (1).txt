Types of Software applications
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
a. Desktop applications
b. Web applications
c. Distrubuted applications
d. Mobile applications
e. AI applications
f. IoT applications
g. 2D and 3D applications

Using UI full stack with React we can build "Webapplications and Distrubutedapplications".
		eg: netflix,youtube,spotify,....

Note::
Desktop application     : No communication with internet
WebApplications
Distrubuted application : using app/browser with the help of internet if the interactions happens then it is web/distrubuted applications.
Mobile application      : calculator,calendar,gallery,....
AI applications         : chatgpt
IoT applications        : smartwatches
2D and 3D applications  : Gaming applications

					Designing webapplications
Q>  What is Internet?
Ans. Internet is a wide area network that connects computers all over the world.
     Internet makes information available any time,any location and from any device.
     First computer network is "ARPANET" introduced by US-DOD[Department of Defence] in early 1960's
     			[Advanced Research Projects Agency Network]
     To use internet during those days we need to learn protocols like SMTP,FTP,.....
     The main problem with internet is "No restrictions", so to avoid this tim berner lee introduced "web".

What is Web?
   A portion of internet with restricted acess.
   Tim Berner Lee(father of web) introduced the concept of Web.
   Web Standards are maintained by W3C(www.w3.org)[World wide web Consortium] and whatwg(http://whatwg.org).
   Darkweb -> not everyone can access[It is illegal way of acccessing the web]
   Currently WebVersion is "WEB-3".
Every webapplication is known as "3 tier application".
Database tier     :: It is a location where data is present.
Application tier  :: It is a location where the application is hosted.  
Presentation tier :: It is a location where we access and use the application.

As a full stack developer we will work with 3 layers
a. Application layer
b. Database layer     
c. Presentation layer :: UI Developer role(HTML,CSS,JS,JQuery,Bootstrap,....)


To work with building webapplications
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
1. Downlad and install "NodeJS" software
    - We are installing Node js for a package manager called "NPM".
    - Package manager is a software tool used to install,update and uninstall a library from your device for any project.
    - There are various package manager called
	a. npm
	b. yarn
	c. rubygems
	d. composer
	e. NuGet
	f. Bower

2. Installation process
	a. visit "https://node.js.org/en"
	b. select the version 20X
	c. Download setup file
        d. Double click install the file
	e. After installing check whether node is installed or not by moving to command prompt
		C:\Users\nitin>node -v
		v20.15.0

		C:\Users\nitin>npm -v
		10.7.0

3. Download and install "Visual Studio Code" editor
	
	- Editor is a software tool used by developers to build,debug,test and deploy applications.
	- Various editors are available for different technologies(https://editorconfig.org/)
		a. sublime
		b. edit+
		c. notepad++
		d. webstorm
		e. vscode etc...
	- link for download https://code.visualstudio.com/

4. Open vscode and install following extensions for Web Designing
	- Live Server [Ritwick Dey]
	- vscode-icons
	- IntelliSense for CSS class names in HTML [Zignd]
	- Live Preview[Microsoft]

Note: Better enable "emmet" in your VS Code. It is a code snippet generator.
	> Go to settings of VS Code
	> Search for "Emmet"
	> Select checkbox for "Show Possible Emment Abbrevations..."

		 
1. Web Server	: It resembles both hardware and software that satisfies client requests by sending and receving the data.
			a. Local server [LiveServer -> Local Server]
			b. Cloud server [AWS,AZURE,GCP,...]

2. Web Site     : It is a virtual directory on webserver that gives access to resources on web.	
		  Every website comprises of 2 locations
		 	a. Physical Location
			b. Virtual  Location
		 Physical Location is a folder where the resources are kept 
			eg: D:\FashionStore
		 Virtual Location is a folder path given to clients inorder to access the resources
			eg: http://www.fashionstore


Creating a new website : [Local]
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
a. Open any new location

b. Create a new folder in any location
	D:\FashionStore

c. Open visual studio code and open your website folder
	[File Menu -> Open Folder]

d. Open "Terminal" in Visual Studio code

e. Switch to "Command Prompt"[Default is Power Shell]	
	
f. Run the following command
	> npm init -y       
    
      * It creates package.json file which is holding meta information about the project[libraries used] 
      * MetaInformation holds name,version and dependencies used in the project[eg:: OpenProject.com]

g. Every Project will consists of 2 standard folders like

     a. public
     b. src
     c. package.json

	* public folder consists of static files like
		a. images[.jpg]
		b. Documents
		c. HTML[.html]
		d. Spreadsheets[.XSLX]
		e. audio/video files

	* src folder comprises of all dynamic resources like
		a. css
		b. scss
		c. js
		d. ts etc..

h. Keeps some documents in the project folder
i. Click on Go live server
j. You can open ur browser and send the request
	http://localhost:5500/

Note: The websiste is live now,but it is not having a good UI for the user to access our resource, 
      so we need to give them a good "webpage", To design a good webpage we go for "HTML/CSS".

WebPage
  -> It is a hypertext document that provides an UI, where the user can interact with the resources of the website.
		eg:: open amazon.com  [It display many information]
		     click on mobiles [It display many information]
  -> It contains information beyond what user can see.
  -> Beyond the content the information is available.
  -> Every webpages are classified into 2 types
	a. Static pages
	b. Dyanmic pages

Static pages 
  -> They are such pages which comprises of same information to display across number of requests.
  -> Usually static pages have extension of ".html/.htm"
		eg:: tutorialspoint website(.html will be the extension)

Dynamic pages
  -> They are such pages which comprises of information according to client requests.
  -> The output would vary from client to client.
  -> Apperance may be same for every client, but the content would be different for user to user
  -> Extension for Dynamic pages are ".jsp,.php,.aspx,....".
		eg:: inox.com(select -> theatre-> select-> book) 
			The information will vary from user to user depending upon the seats available.

Note: Static pages and dynamic pages are desinged using "HTML"

PageComposition
	Static  Pages :: HTML + CSS + JavaScript + jQuery + ....
	Dynamic Pages :: HTML + CSS + JavaScript + jQuery + JSP|PHP|ASP.... 

Note: Every Project will start with a static page called "index.html"

Browser Architecture
++++++++++++++++++++
 - Browser is a software tool to access webpages on the client device.
 - Various browser available are
	a. Chrome
	b. Firefox
	c. Edge
	d. Safari
 - Every browser comprises of following components
	a. User interface : It contains title bar, address bar, refresh ....
	b. Browser Engine : It is responsible for converting HTML,CSS into browser understable format.
				Every browser has browser engine
				a. Gecko
				b. webkit
				c. chakra
				d. SpiderMonkey
	c. Rendering  Engine: It is responsible for presentation of processed content.
	d. Javascript Interpreter: Every browser uses javascript as a langauge for interactions,It is translated using JS interpreter.
	e. Network : It monitors the activity performed in a page when requested in browser.
			a. Resource loaded
			b. Number of request per page
			c. Time taken to load Content 
	f. UI Backend : It contains the logic for UserInterface of the browser.
	g. DataPersistence : It is a location where browser can store client details
				a. Local storage
				b. Session storage
				c. Cookies etc...
