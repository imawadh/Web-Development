    JavaScript is light weight Interpreted and Just-in-Time Compiled programming language.

    Light weight refers to memory occupied and how heavy the application is.

    Interpreted refers to line by line translation.

    Compiled refers to translating entire program, all lines of program are translated simultaneously at the same time.
    	a) JIT compiled
    	b) AOT compiled

    JIT [Just-in-Time]  is the process where JavaScript is loaded into browser and compiled in browser
    			[This happens when the user sends the request].

    AOT [Ahead-of-Time] is the process where JavaScript is compiled and processed at application level.
    			[Even before the request comes this process would happen]

    We can use various engines and compilers
    a) Ivy
    b) Babel
    c) Node
    d) V8

    JavaScript supports various programming techniques and approaches
    	a) Structural Programming
    	b) Functional Programming
    	c) Imperative Programming
    	d) Object Oriented Programming etc..

    Note: JavaScript is not an OOP language, It supports only few features of OOP.

    JavaScript is a programming language, which is used at different layers of our projects
    a) Client Side  	: with HTML
    b) Server Side  	: with Node JS
    c) Database     	: MongoDB
    d) Animation Tools 	: Flash, 3DS Max, etc..

    FAQ: 
      1. What are the issues with javascript?
    ans.   a = 10;	     javascript is not "strongly" typed [ no datatypes on a variable]
    	a = "sachin";
    	a = false;
    	a = 13.5;

    	javascript is not "strictly" typed 
    		[ without declaring the variable it permits us to use]
    	"use strict"; 
    	a = 10;

    	javascript doesn't restrict to control the data in uniform manner.
    	[
    		{
    			Name : "samsung", price: 45000
    		},
    		{
    			Product : "LG", cost : 55000
    		}
    	]

    	JavaScript is not secured and it can be blocked by browser.
    	eg:: Trojan    [install this virus in one computer we can control that device:: Bad approach].
    	     TeamViewer[install this software so we can control the device for installing softwares: Good approach].
