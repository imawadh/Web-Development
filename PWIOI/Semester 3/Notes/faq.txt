FAQ 2:::
    
    -> How to convert HTMLCollection to Array?
    Ans. arrayElements = Array.from(HtmlCollection)

    a. why do we need so many methods to target HTML page using javascript ,when we can target
	directly with single method called 'querySelectorXXX()'?

    Ans. Older version of javascript added methods like
		    getElementById(),getElementsByClassName(),getElementsByTagName(),....
    
    As css become popular, to give the direct support of accessing the elements using CSS
    methods like querySelector() and querySelectorAll() were added.


	querySelector | querySelectorAll|getElementById ===> works only for staticDOM
	getElementsByClassName() 
	getElementsByTagName()	====> Dynamic DOM
 	getElementsByName()
