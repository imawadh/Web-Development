FAQ 2:::
    
    -> How to convert HTMLCollection to Array?
    Ans. arrayElements = Array.from(HtmlCollection)

    a. why do we need so many methods to target HTML page using javascript ,when we can target
	directly with single method called 'querySelectorXXX()'?

    Ans. Older version of javascript added methods like
		    getElementById(),getElementsByClassName(),getElementsByTagName(),....
    
    As css become popular, to give the direct support of accessing the elements using CSS
    methods like querySelector() and querySelectorAll() were added.


	querySelector | querySelectorAll|getElementById ===> works only for staticDOM
	getElementsByClassName() 
	getElementsByTagName()	====> Dynamic DOM
 	getElementsByName() 
FAQ 3:::
	What is the difference b/w innerText vs textContent?
	Ans. 
	Note: 
	Use textContent when:
	You want all the text (including text from hidden elements).
	Performance is important, especially when you don’t need to worry about layout or CSS visibility.
	You are manipulating raw text, and you don’t care about white spaces or hidden elements.

	Use innerText when:
	You want the visible text, and you're dealing with text that might have styling (like hidden elements or user interactions).
	You need to respect CSS visibility and layout.
	It’s important that the text looks like it does on screen, including white spaces and line breaks.
