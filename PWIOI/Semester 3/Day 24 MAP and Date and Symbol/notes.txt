What are the limitation of Object Data Type ?
Ans ... 
        1. Keys must of of String Type
        2. No standarad api on its own to tell the no. of keys present in an object.
        3. Searching ans deletion on its own cann't be done it should be with help of operators (of object class).
        4. Best Suited only when data is "Structured" else it fails ..
        5. Insertion order is not preserved in Object while is preserved in case of Map it preserved 

    Map is the solution to all these problems which were with Object ....

set()      :: It is used to assign a new key with the value to a map
get()      :: It returns the value of key of a map

- If we use == | === operator on Symbol type with the smae key result would be false.
- We can use "toStirng()" to convert symbol type in String ....
