What is Shallow Copy ? 
Shallow copy copy the top-level properties of an object only. If the object 



What is Deep Cloning ? 
A deep copy craetes a completely independent obejct, including all the nested objects ans arrays .... No shared Referenece... 

To create a deep clone of an object we use structuredClone(objectName); 



Rules of RestOperator :::

1. Every function must have at most one rest operator 
    e.g; function(...r1,...r2) // Invalid

2. In a function we can keep normal parameter as well as rest operator but rest operator should be last parameter of function
    e.g; function(...r1,n1) // Invalid
         function(n1,...r1) // Invalid



What is the difference between Spread Operator and Rest Operator ? 


















function Generators ::: 
Syntax ::: 
========
    function* gerateFunction(){
        yield value1;
        yield value2;
        yield value3;
        ....
    }


    function* generatePlayers(){
        yield "Gavaskar";
        yield "Sachin";
        yield "Kohli";
        yield "GILL"
    }

    let players = generatePlayers();
    console.log(players);
    let res = players.next();
    while(!res.done){
        console.log(res);
        res = res.next();
    }


================================================
HOF 
===
A function which excepts a functiona s the parameter is called as HOF ....
A function that is passed as arguments is called as CallBack function ....







================================================================================================================
It is possible to make any userdefined function to make it a part of any inbuilt class.
Syntax ::: 
    className.prototype.key = value[function(), Object{}]


e.g#1;
