What is React.createElement?

    1. It's a function used to create React elements, which are essentially lightweight JavaScript objects that represent the structure of the UI that React manages.

    2. React elements act as instructions for React to build and update the actual DOM elements in the browser.

    3. It serves as the underlying mechanism behind JSX (JavaScript XML), a syntax extension that allows you to write HTML-like code within your JavaScript files.

    The React.createElement function accepts three main arguments: 

        1. Type: Specifies the element type, which can be an HTML tag string, a React component (class or functional), or a React Fragment.

        2. Props: An object containing properties or attributes for the element or component. This includes standard HTML attributes or custom properties for React components. Special props like ref and key are accessible directly on the element, not through element.props.

        3. Children (optional): The nested elements or content within the created element. Children can be various types, including other React elements, strings, numbers, or arrays of nodes.
