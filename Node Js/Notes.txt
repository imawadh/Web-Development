What Node.Js does ? 
    1. Create Server
    2. Business Logic
    3. Return Response 

http.createSever(callback) --> How to create a server ?  
serverName.listen(port Number) --> How to listen a request at a port number ? 
process.exit() --> Server ko kaise band kare 

req.url --> url where it will be accessed at port in the browser ....
req.methods --> method of acesss
req.headers --> header of request object 

stream --> data transfer is ij the form of small chunks ... 
sockets --->  it is communication gateway i.e. where data pass ethorough it only whenever it is required .... just like waky talky ... 

chunks ---> smallest part of data tranfer is called as chunk .... 
data transfer is nothing but continuous flow of chunks of data.... 
the most important benefit of chunk is that as soon as the first chunk comes the data processing starts... 

Buffers --- > data ko ek jagah karke meaningful data bana ke return karega...
